Leaflet measure control
=======================

This fork is created to publish the plugin on npm, contact me to transfer the rights for the npm module.

```sh
npm install -S leaflet-measure2
```

Adds a button below the map's zoom controls that allows you to activate an interactive mode to measure distances on the map.

More info coming soon...
